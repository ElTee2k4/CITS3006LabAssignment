Yo Head Hackerman,

Im ready to go boss, I just made my security account! I just need your permission
and then i'm ready to make this system have more layers of security then an onion. I'm hoping to start
work on the key generation for your encryption schema probably first. We're still using AES for now though
with the key gen in the code right?

Best regards,
Bob
